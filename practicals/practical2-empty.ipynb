    "# Practical 2: Calculating gravity disturbances from absolute gravity\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical 1, we learned how to process the raw gravimeter relative readings into absolute gravity values. These data are affected by the entire mass of the Earth, which masks the small variations associated with crustal geological structures (our targets). So we have to **remove the effect of all other masses** before we can interpret the data in terms of crustal geology.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll do this in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Elimintate the effect of most of the Earth's mass and rotation by removing **normal gravity**\n",
    "2. Remove the effect of topography above the ellipsoid by removing the gravity of a **Bouguer plate**\n",
    "3. Isolate shallower and local crustal structures by removing a **regional field**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **residual field** that is left after these steps should be close to the gravitational attraction resulting from our geological structures. Of course, the way we calculate all of them relies on approximations and more accurate methods exist but would be more than we can cover in a single practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement the normal gravity and Bouguer plate calculations in Python\n",
    "* Calculate a residual gravity disturbance around Cape Town\n",
    "* Correlate the observed residual field to known local geology\n",
