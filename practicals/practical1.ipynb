    "# Practical 1: Processing ground-based gravity data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical, we'll process a set of synthetic gravity surveys near the city of Cape Town, South Africa. The surveys were conducted with a LaCoste & Romberg Model G gravimeter and tied to a single base station (station 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data \n",
    "\n",
    "For this practical, you'll need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A zip archive with the survey data: [`cape-town-surveys.zip`](https://github.com/leouieda/gravity-processing/raw/main/data/cape-town-surveys.zip)\n",
    "* The gravimeter calibration table to convert readings to mGal: [`gravimeter-scaling.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leouieda/gravity-processing/main/data/gravimeter-scaling.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "Download both files, unzip the archive, and place everything into the **same folder as this notebook**. Your should folder structure should look like this:\n",
