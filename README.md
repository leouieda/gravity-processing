# Processing gravimetry data with Python

Lesson on processing ground survey gravimetry data for geophysics with Python.

The lesson focuses on fundamentals and does relies only on the standard
scientific Python stack (numpy, matplotlib, etc).
Corrections and processing are implemented in the lesson as a way to impart
deeper understanding of how they work, avoiding the blackbox approach that
would result from the use of ready-made software.
